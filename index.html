He is 5'9" (176 centimeters) tall.[3] He is currently engaged to his girlfriend Kayla.

He later began playing more variety games like Garry's Mod, and would do ask-me-anything vlogs. He later started livestreaming the games he would normally play in his YouTube videos.

            Roblox
            Later in 2016, Kreek discovered the game "Roblox", when it was becoming popular at the time. On Roblox, he first played Phantom Forces, the starter game for many YouTubers. Later, he began streaming Roblox almost daily. Around that same time, his Fan Mail series ended. In April 2017, Jailbreak was released, and Kreek began playing it. He enjoyed it and it became the main game he played on his channel from 2017-2020. In early 2020, he "quit" Jailbreak and began playing the game Piggy as it rose in popularity. He has also claimed that the Roblox Ready Player One Event made him popular.

            Fortnite
            Sometime in 2018, he announced he would be making a second channel called "Kreek - Fortnite". The channel uploaded Fortnite gameplay videos and tips on how to obtain V-Bucks, Fortnite's' in-game currency. It is now the renamed to Kreeky and no longer posts Fortnite content. He made a return to Fortnite by streaming the Ariana Grande Live Event and also stated on that stream why he doesn't post Fortnite related content anymore. He no longer posts Fortnite anymore due to controversy. This is a possible chance of him bringing it back.
